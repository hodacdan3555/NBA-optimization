In this project, we apply the principles learned in our Deterministic Operations Research (OR) model class to optimize the formation of a competitive basketball team in Montreal, aiming to surpass the Toronto Raptors. Leveraging mathematical optimization models, robust optimization techniques, and data analysis, we strive to achieve a strategic balance between performance and financial efficiency in team building.
