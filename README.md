In this project, we apply the principles learned in our Deterministic Operations Research (OR) model class to optimize the formation of a competitive basketball team in Montreal, aiming to surpass the Toronto Raptors. Leveraging mathematical optimization models, robust optimization techniques, and data analysis, we strive to achieve a strategic balance between performance and financial efficiency in team building.
As collaborators and friends on this odyssey, our goal extends beyond the basketball court. We navigate the intricacies of coding, applying theoretical concepts to real-world challenges. This endeavor serves as a canvas where our skills in optimization are not just showcased but refined and expanded.
Project Highlights

    -Strategic Team Building: We meticulously apply principles learned in class to strategically select players, drawing insights from deterministic OR models.

    -Data-Driven Decisions: We embrace the power of data analysis, weaving it into the fabric of our optimization journey. Through datasets, we uncover patterns that guide our decisions.

    -Optimization Unleashed: The Python code we've crafted is more than just lines; it's a manifestation of our dedication to mastering optimization techniques. Through practical solutions, we transform theoretical knowledge into tangible outcomes.
